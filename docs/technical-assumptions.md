# PDF Structure Analysis Tool - Technical Implementation Assumptions

This document focuses only on implementation assumptions not already covered in the existing project documentation. For feature priorities, see `features.md`.

## Technology & Platform Decisions

- **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS and shadcn UI components
- **Backend**: API service with PDF processing engine (Go-pdfium)
- **Storage**: S3 buckets for PDF storage and processed results
- **Platform Support**: 
  - Desktop: Full-featured experience
  - Mobile: Limited to PDF upload and list view only
- **UI Style**: Application-like interface for future desktop app transition potential

## User Management & Integration

- Leverage existing platform authentication system
- Each user has their own workspace identified by user ID
- No need to build new authentication flows

## Processing Architecture

### Data Flow
1. User uploads PDF file or provides URL
2. PDF is stored in S3 bucket
3. Asynchronous processing job extracts metadata and renders layers
4. Frontend receives processed data for visualization
5. User manipulates visualization layers and outlines client-side

### Processing Considerations
- Heavy processing tasks handled by backend
- Large document support handled transparently to frontend
- Processing status feedback provided to user
- Error handling with option to reprocess documents

## Analysis Approach
- Single document analysis only (no batch processing)
- Positioned as a debugging tool for individual PDFs

## Feature Implementation Alignment
- **Must Have (M01, M02)**: Focus implementation on core layer slicing and interactive controls
- **Should Have (S01, S02)**: Plan for zero-area detection and repeated pattern detection as secondary priorities
- **Could Have (C01, C02)**: Consider export and custom colors only after core functionality
- All "Won't Have" items remain explicitly out of scope
