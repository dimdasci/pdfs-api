- Detection results are stored with the document

## Development Notes

1. **Demo Frequency**: Plan to demonstrate progress after each step, not waiting for phase completion.

2. **Technical Dependencies**: Steps assume the backend PDFium integration is established according to the technical summary document.

3. **Incremental Development**: Each step builds upon previous ones, minimizing any throw-away work.

4. **UI Flexibility**: While working toward the final wireframe designs, intermediate steps may use simplified UI elements that deliver the same functionality.

5. **Validation Points**: After Steps 5, 12, and 17, schedule brief user testing sessions to validate the approach before proceeding further.
